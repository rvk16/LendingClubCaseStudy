## General Information
Lending club is the largest peer-to-peer marketplace connecting borrowers with lenders. Borrowers apply
through an online platform where they are assigned an internal score. Lenders decide 1) whether to lend and
2) the terms of loan such as interest rate, monthly instalment, tenure etc.
Some popular products are credit card loans, debt consolidation loans, house loans, car loans etc.

## Conclusions
- Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan  default.
- Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information  from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).
- Lending Club should control their number of loan issues to borrowers who are from CA, FL and  NY to make profits.
- Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to  them.
- Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved  loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more  than 12000.
- People with more number of public derogatory records are having more chance of filing a  bankruptcy. Lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for borrower.
